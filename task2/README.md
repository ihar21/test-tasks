# Big O
Maze generation - O(n) where n depends on maze size.
Moving(Access) - O(1). The player moves through the labyrinth using coordinates that can be easily changed when accessing a two-dimensional array. Therefore, the player will not go through every cell of the maze and there is no point in brute force.
